# ExtendableSparseParallel

This repository contains a structure which should be used for matrix assembly in multithreaded Finite-Volume- or Finite-Element computations in Julia.
The structure and idea are very similar to JÃ¼rgen Fuhrmann's [ExtendableSparse.jl](https://github.com/j-fu/ExtendableSparse.jl).
